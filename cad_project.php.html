		<h1>
			CAD Project
		</h1>
		<p>
			The Computer Aided Design (CAD) Project spawned from the idea that SAB needed some type of 
			physical representation of where a sponsor's logo would be on the finished plane. After 
			messing around for an hour or two, we had a rough model that looked similar to a finished 
			RV-7A that would serve as an example as to where each tier of logo would go. From this 
			model, we came up with the idea of teaching a CAD program to our members, specifically 
			those in the Aerospace Department who have no experience with any type Computer Aided 
			Design as there is currently no class dedicated to teaching them.
		</p>

		<p>
			From this idea we morphed the program from just a teaching aspect into something that would 
			be more directly beneficial in the short and long run. We decided we were going to CAD the 
			plane in its entirety, down to every piece of sheet metal. For this we would need a large 
			number of members in order to not be overloaded. Students are always very interested in 
			gaining marketable skills, and they have proved that tendency with us. We are very pleased 
			with our success and the program will only continue to grow as the next school year rolls around.
		</p>

		<p>
			The idea behind CADing the plane serves 4 purposes: 
			<ol>
			<li>Draw in new members as an easy, 
			fun, and non-time consuming project that gives them an opportunity to work with the plane 
			and allows for advancement through the organization in the years to come.</li>
			<li>Teach students 
			different CAD programs. Currently the Mechanical Department teaches Pro Engineer/Wildfire 
			5.0, so we will be able to draw strongly from those skilled students, but we will also be 
			teaching NX 8.0, drawing from the experience of students and faculty with industry experience
			in NX.</li>
			<li>Assist our 
			Project Manager in creating build directions by providing him with part drawings so he can 
			give a physical representation of the directions and show exactly how pieces are to go 
			together. </li>
			<li>Be able to run Finite Element Analysis on the finished model for future 
			research into plane design.</li>
			</ol>
		
		</p>
		<p>
		The project was started mid-semester last spring, and the foundations are laid as we move through the 
		summer and into the next school year. We are teaching our members using short videos of each function 
		as well as personal teaching from other students to answer any questions the members have when learning 
		to CAD. This teaching model was tested briefly before the year ended, and worked very well in the limited 
		amount of time we had. Members were able go at their own pace and skip back and forth through the video 
		in case they forgot how to do something, while student teachers assisted in any questions or difficulties 
		they were having.
