			Build Implementation
		</h2>
		<h3>
			Build Process
		</h3>
		<p>
			To maximize efficiency we created the following process to guide the individual teams and how they interact to ensure fluid progress
		</p>
		<img src="Images/Build_Implementation/build_process_diagram.png" title="Build Cycle"/>
		<!--
		<h3>
			Modeling the Aircraft Parts
		</h3>
		<p>
			<i>CAD Team</i><br/>
			From the reception of the subsection, SAB members on the CAD team begin measuring and
			creating models of the prefabricated parts. Modeling of the theoretical final assemblies
			will take place simultaneously. The team will make use of both NX (aka Unigraphics) and
			ProEngineer in recognition of the registration limitations on the classes offered by the
			University.
		</p>

			Creation of Instructions
		</h2>
		<h3 class="title">
		Project Manager and Deputy Project Managers
		</h3>
		<p>
			The Project Manager and his deputies begin analyzing the assembly and fabrication
			procedures of the relevant aircraft subsection. This team works to create 3 unique sets of
			instructions, created for the purposes of concurrent construction with 3 builders and 1
			foreman supervising. The instructions are highly detailed. Additionally, the Project
			Management team works to create written references on the parts themselves, such as shading
			the sections of a part to be removed during fabrication or marking the diameter of the rivet
			to be secured. The instructions will be crafted to allow concurrent construction when
			possible.
		</p>
		<img src="Images/Build_Implementation/project_manager.jpg"/>
		<h2 class="smush">
			Build Management Briefing
		</h2>
		<h3 class="title">
			Project Manager and Deputy Project Managers
		</h3>
		<p>
			The project management team uses these instructions and the CAD models to create a
			presentation for the technical project manager, the build managers, and the foremen.
			This explanation will be cursory. The primary purpose will be to familiarize the Build
			Management and Technical Project Manager with the gist of the assembly, while addressing
			expected problems and hang-ups. Technical building tips such as fluting techniques will
			not be discussed.
		</p>
		<img src="Images/Build_Implementation/blue_prints.jpg">
		<h2 class="smush">
			Builder Briefings
		</h2>
		<h3 class="title">
			Project Management and Build Management
		</h3>
		<p>
			The technical project manager will prepare an in-depth description of procedures and
			methods, reminding the builders of common mistakes. The Technical Project Manager will use
			CAD models and photographs to assist in the subsection assembly presentation. This
			presentation will be prepared in layman's terms, with the awareness that most builders lack
			intense familiarity with aircraft assembly. There will be multiple meetings to distribute
			this information, each led by the Technical Project Manager and Build Managers. The current
			intention involves an initial meeting at the hangar using the prefabricated aircraft parts
			as an aid. This meeting will grant priority hangar session registration privileges. Another
			meeting, or series of meetings, will take place at lecture halls on campus. Attending these
			meetings will grant secondary registration privileges. At all meetings, handouts of
			instructions will be given to the builders. In addition, the builders will have access to
			the documents online.
		</p>

		<h2 class="smush">
			Build Registration and Coordination
		</h2>
		<h3 class="title">
			Project Coordinator (a.k.a. Hand of God)
		</h3>
		<p>
			The Project Coordinator will facilitate registration. Foremen availabilities will be due
			one week prior to the inception of construction on the relevant subsection. A Google
			Spreadsheet will be made available to primary registrants one week prior to the build
			week. Several days past this, secondary registrants will be granted access. Finally, at
			the start of the build week, registration will open to all builders, irrespective of
			assembly familiarity.

			Construction Ensues
		</h2>
		<h3 class="title">
			Foremen and Builders
		</h3>
		<p>
			Assembly will take place in sessions lasting approximately 4 hours during the week, with
			several sessions taking place per day on the weekend. Three builders will be scheduled per
			session, supervised by an experienced builder appointed as a foreman. Concurrent
			construction will take place as often as is feasible. The foreman will assist as required
			with the three instruction sets, and will also act as a third builder in the case that all
			builders do not attend.
