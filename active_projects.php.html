			Explaining what SAB does can get difficult at times. We started with one inspired idea, refined it a bit, and then watched it explode into half a dozen others - just as inspiring. Experienced project managers, when acquainted with SAB, call it 'scope creep'. <br/><br/>We call it progress. <br/><br/>Because, unlike your standard project, a movement doesn't have a defined labor base and doesn't have an end date. A movement draws support from each member that gets caught in the waves of enthusiasm. And our movement is towards great engineering.<br/><br/></p>

			<img class="bio_pic" src="Images/2013-14_Project/Zenith_Plane.png">
			<p>
				We start that off with our mainstay, the Zenith CH 750. It's a beautiful aircraft, and made by a truly amazing company. We're building the plane using SAB crafted manufacturing instructions and a team of engineering students as our fabricators (half of which have never touched a power tool before). Now, that scares some people - and at face value, we can understand that. So it should be all the more intriguing that there's not one of us that wouldn't put ourselves into the finished airplane. How can we trust our system that strongly? Check out our <a href="build_implementation.php.html">build process</a> to understand.</p>

			<h2 class="active_projects">Project Management</h2>

			<img class="bio_pic" src="Images/Active_Projects/9_small.jpg">

			<p>
				In a liberal interpretation of the term "project managment", this team is responsible for all work on the CH 750 project which is not directly related to construction. Most of the work that entails is the creation of the instructions used by the builders and foremen. The assembly instructions offered by the manufacturer often have inaccuraccies, inconsistencies, and ambiguities. Those are typically only resolved after deeply analyzing the provided plans (which <i>are</i> perfectly accurate). It's a very work intensive process, and to ensure the quality of our instructions, a system of checks is necessary. To learn about our process, make the jump to our <a href="project_management.php.html">Project Management</a> page.</p>

			<h2 class="active_projects">Dynamic Instructions</h2>
			<p>
				Dynamic Instructions is a computer program developed by CS students working with SAB. The program takes all the instructions written by the Project Management team along with constraints on step order, tools, materials and gathers information about the builder's current progress through a user interface. When a builder finishes a step, the program calculates the optimal next step to begin so the construction process is as efficient as possible and now, we're demoing it for the training toolboxes! You can read a full description of the program and its goals <a href="dynamic_instructions.php.html">here</a>.</p>

			<p>
				The former NX and ProEngineer CAD Teams have integrated into one new Design Team! This team's mission is to design a small scale semi-glider (6 - 7 ft wingspan) along with a launch system that can get the glider to a desired altitude, a power system that will increase flight time, and an avionics system to remotely interact with the glider. After the design is completed in the spring, the Design Team hopes to build the glider in the fall. The long-term goal of the Design Team is to use this experience to learn the hurdles of designing an aircraft and establish a framework for future SAB design challenges. You can find out more about the project <a href="design_team.php.html">here</a>.</p>

			<h2 class="active_projects">Corvair Engine Build</h2>
			<img class="bio_pic" src="Images/Active_Projects/corvair_engine.jpg">
			<p>
				We plan on flying our 750, so obviously we'll need an engine. Unfortunately for our budget, new aircraft engines will run upwards of $20,000, which is as much as the entirety of the Zenith kit! Our solution: rebuilding an engine from a 1960s Corvair. Intrigued? <a href="engine_team.php.html">Read more</a>.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

				Computer Aided Manufacturing and Training is a foray into the world of quality control using computer vision to quickly and objectively check the construction being performed. The effort involves developing a method to capture images of completed aircraft parts in such a way that they would be decipherable by a computer. This transformation of images to data will need to be developed along with a logic engine that could then use the data to determine if the parts match tolerances given by the manufacturer. This project would run side by side with aircraft construction and its primary goal is assuring quality in some aspect of the build. The four aspects we will start with are distance and measurement correction, bend radius and angle measurement, planar judging, and rivet analysis through geometry.
