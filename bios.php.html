			Bio of Team SAB
		</h1>
		<p>
			SAB was founded by friends has been a fraternal effort. SAB should be as friendly and social 
			and inspiring as possible. The origins of the project speak well to the atmosphere that should surround 
			the project: "Erik Lopez's Super Secret Project." All the fun, goofing, mystery, and intrigue of 
			"Erik Lopez's Super Secret Project"should not be lost in the bureaucracy that running SAB entails.<br/>
			<br/>
			We, college students, young 20-somethings, rather inexperienced airplane builders, are 
			building an airplane. How cool is that? Mistakes will be made, obstacles will be circumvented,
			but we are all learning together. <br/>
			<br/>
			SAB welcomes novice. SAB is structured so that everyone is qualified. All that SAB asks is 
			that a person come into the organization ready to work, learn, and have fun. SAB was created 
			so that students would have a chance to take on a hands-on project. What could be more hands-on 
			than constructing an airplane? <br/>
