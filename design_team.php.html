			Design Team
		</h1>

		<p>
			The former NX and ProEngineer CAD Teams have integrated into the new Design Team that will be designing a small scale semi-glider (two meter wingspan).  Included in this design is a launch system that will get the glider to altitude, a power system that will increase flight time, and an avionics system to send and receive data from the glider.  After design is completed in the spring, the design team hopes to build the glider in the fall.  The long-term goal of the design team is to use this experience to learn the hurdles of designing an aircraft and establish a framework for future SAB design challenges.

			The top level concept for this semester is a bio-diesel powered glider with a two meter wingspan which will achieve a glide ratio of thirty.  It will weigh under three kilograms and will be ground launched. We'll have an onboard camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU), providing data which will be relayed back through the avionics system to our ground control.  Our glider this semester is a fairly modest project to introduce the concept of design to the team. Next semester we will be building and testing the glider.

			The idea behind CADing the plane serves 4 purposes: 
			<ol>
			<li>Draw in new members as an easy, 
			fun, and non-time consuming project that gives them an opportunity to work with the plane 
			and allows for advancement through the organization in the years to come.</li>
			<li>Teach students 
			different CAD programs. Currently the Mechanical Department teaches Pro Engineer/Wildfire 
			5.0, so we will be able to draw strongly from those skilled students, but we will also be 
			teaching NX 8.0, drawing from the experience of students and faculty with industry experience
			in NX.</li>
			<li>Assist our 
			Project Manager in creating build directions by providing him with part drawings so he can 
			give a physical representation of the directions and show exactly how pieces are to go 
			together. </li>
			<li>Be able to run Finite Element Analysis on the finished model for future 
			research into plane design.</li>
			</ol>
		
		</p>
		<p>
		The project was started mid-semester last spring, and the foundations are laid as we move through the 
		summer and into the next school year. We are teaching our members using short videos of each function 
		as well as personal teaching from other students to answer any questions the members have when learning 
		to CAD. This teaching model was tested briefly before the year ended, and worked very well in the limited 
		amount of time we had. Members were able go at their own pace and skip back and forth through the video 
		in case they forgot how to do something, while student teachers assisted in any questions or difficulties 
		they were having.
