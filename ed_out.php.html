		<h1>
			Educational Outreach
		</h1>
		<p>
			Being an inspiration to students who may lack drive or direction is an opportunity we do 
			not take for granted. As such, educational outreach represents a major focus of SAB. The 
			goal of educational outreach is to inspire students and awe them with science and 
			engineering in a fun and educational way. Our hope is that we can inspire the next 
			generation of great minds in these fields and give them something to strive for as well as 
			to show students that not only are subjects like math and science fun, but important for 
			everyday life. We have the unique ability to get our message across in that we are building 
			an actual aircraft and are comprised of members only a few years older than our audience. 
			As the aircraft takes form, SAB would like to exhibit their progress as well as teach people 
			about what SAB does. The build process will be visually documented so SAB can show 
			interested viewers how the build progress occurs. SAB plans to have other lesson plans to 
			educate children on the basics of flight and aviation in order to spur interests in younger 
			students. Once the aircraft is complete, SAB plans to exhibit the aircraft at various shows 
			around the nation in order to educate people on building and flying kit aircraft.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our two most successful outreach programs took place this semester in the form of 
			Engineering Open House and Illinois Space Day. At EOH, we were able to present a nearly 
			completed empennage to hundreds of future engineers. We talked to students ranging in age 
			from kindergarten to seniors in high school. For the younger students we helped them put 
			together balsa wood airplanes. We answered questions from the high school students about a 
			possible future in engineering. 
		</p>

		<h1>
			Plans for 2013-2014 Academic Year
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Young Eagles and Build Shadowing with University High
		</h2>
		<p>
			The Young Eagles is an organization that hosts events where students get to learn about 
			aviation and even experience a fun flight with members of the Experimental Aircraft 
			Association. We hope to involve SAB in their events and publications.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Campus Projects - University High Build Shadow
		</h2>
		<p>
			Build shadowing with the University High School at UIUC, will involve students coming to the 
			hangar with the builders and learning about building an airplane. They will also get to do 
			hands on work while learning specific skills, workshop practices, and general safety 
			procedures.
		</p>

			Past Outreach Events

		<h2>
			Illinois Space Day 2013
		</h2>
		<p>
			Illinois Space Day is an event where elementary and middle school students come to the 
			university to learn about, and be inspired by, space. ISD is sponsored by the Illinois 
			Space Society, but many of the student organizations in the Aerospace Department 
			participate, including SAB. For ISD, we displayed the vertical and horizontal stabilizers, 
			as well as gave a 30 minute video presentation on the future of technology and space 
			exploration. Illinois alumni and four time space shuttle astronaut Scott Altman also gave 
			a presentation about his trips to space and the Hubble telescope, on which all four of his 
			missions were focused.

		<h2>
			EOH 2013
		</h2>
		<p>
			At EOH, we were able to present a nearly completed empennage to hundreds of future 
			engineers. We talked to students ranging in age from kindergarten to seniors in high 
			school. For the younger students we helped them put together balsa wood airplanes. We 
			answered questions from the high school students about having a future in engineering. 
			We are extremely excited for EOH 2014 as we will have some serious plane to display.

		<h2>
			Talks at local High Schools
		</h2>
		<p>
			Our main endeavor for next year is reaching out to students outside of the University of 
			Illinois. We will do this by giving talks at local high schools regarding science and 
			engineering and doing science projects with local grade schools. Our presentations at local 
			high schools will hopefully help students find a path towards a future in science and 
			engineering. The goal for the science projects that we will do at the local grade schools 
			will show the students how fun science can be.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Science Day at Mahomet, IL
		</h2>
		<p>
			Science Day is an event hosted by the schools in Mahomet, Illinois featuring science 
			presenters from the community offering hands-on science demonstrations to K-5th grade 
			students. This event lets us really step back and simplify what we are doing and learning 
			at SAB so that a K-5 grade child can understand.
		</p>

		<h2>
			EOH 2014
		</h2>
		<p>
			Engineering Open House was a great success. We had our booth on the Bardeen Quad, and it was flooded by over one hundred visitors! SAB showed off their progress on our airplane. There were plenty of hands on activities for visitors to do. Everyone quickly found out that anyone can build a plane with projects like candy airplanes, balsa wood airplanes, and the our build team's sheet metal airplane project (CAD model <a href="models/eoh_project.php.html">here</a>) that allowed the visitors to get hands on riveting experience.  </p>
		<img src="Images/Ed_Out/eoh_2014_a.jpg"/>
		
		<p>
			Engineering Open House also led to some amazing opportunities for outreach. Three groups came to our booth and asked for information about outreach opportunities. These include the Boy Scouts, Boys and Girls Club, and a local school. SAB looks forward to working with all of them.  </p>
		<img src="Images/Ed_Out/eoh_2014_b.jpg"/>
		
		<p>
			SAB Educational Outreach also got to use the Gates Scholar grant that we received. We bought materials for Engineering Open House, RC airplanes, and much more. All of which will be great tools for further education. We are extremely thankful for the grant!</p>
