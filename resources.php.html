		<h1>
			Resources
		</h1>
		<p>
			As a result of our close relationship with the University of Illinois, the Department of 
			Aerospace, and the Institute of Aviation, we have a variety of resources at our disposal. 
			Our early sponsorships have allowed us to obtain the materials needed to begin construction. 
			The materials in our possession and the resources at our disposal are listed below. 
		</p>
		<h2>
			Hangar
		</h2>
		<p>
			We have been granted access to a hangar at the Institute of Aviation at the University of 
			Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as our workshop. This hangar was specifically designed for 
			maintenance and construction of small aircraft. As such, the hangar is wired for all 
			electrical needs of our organization. The Institute of Aviation has generously allowed us 
			unrestricted access to the hard piped, high flow compressor within the building. Fortunately 
			for our builders, the hangar is temperature controlled (heating and air conditioning). In 
			addition, there is a regularly maintained restroom very nearby. We possess 6 workbenches 
			which will soon be mounted with benchtop machinery. This will grant us the ability to conduct 
			concurrent construction and fully utilize the considerable personnel resources that we 
			possess. 
		</p>
		<h2>
			Tools
		</h2>
		<p>
			To date, we currently possess all of the tools vital for construction of a sheet metal aircraft. This 
			includes:
			<ul>
				<li>Cleaveland Kit</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This tool kit was put together based on what most homebuilders get by the time 
					they are done building the airframe. Includes 3X Rivet Gun, C-Frame Riveting Tool, 
					Main Squeeze with 3" Yoke, &frac14;" Air Drill, and other various tools and related 
					components.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Air Conpressor</li>
				<li>6" Bench Grinder</li>
				<li>5" Swivel Vise with Anvil</li>
				<li>4" x 36" Belt/Disc Combination Benchtop Sander</li>
				<li>12" Ratchet Bar Clamps</li>
				<li>12" Quick Release Locking C-Clamps</li>
				<li>Various hand tools</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>
			Empennage Kit
		</h2>
		<p>
			Stored in our hangar is the kit for constructing the empennage (tail) section of an RV-7a. 
			It includes all necessary parts for the completion empennage section such as sheet metal, 
			ribs, and hardware.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Talbot Lab
		</h2>
		<p>
			Talbot Lab, home to the Department of Aerospace Engineering, is our primary space for 
			meetings, website development, sponsorship solicitation, recruitment, and organization.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Engineering Student Projects Lab (ESPL)
		</h2>
		<p>
			ESPL grants College of Engineering students workspace, tools, and a partial machine shop for 
			use in extracurricular projects and activities. The machine shop includes a CNC mill, lathe, 
			vertical band saw, and multiple drill presses. There is also a meeting room with computers, 
			conference table, and 3' vinyl cutter.
		</p>
		<a href="http://it.engineering.illinois.edu/ews/" style = "text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><h2>Engineering Workstations</h2></a>
		<p>
			As University of Illinois, College of Engineering students, members of Student Aircraft 
			Builders have 24/7 access to powerful computer stations on campus. Through these stations, 
			members have at their disposal a wide number of useful engineering, administration, and 
			project management software. Engineering workstations also include access to office tools 
			such as scanners, copiers, and printers. 
		</p>
		<a href="http://engineering.illinois.edu/about-us/grainger-engineering-library" style = "text-decoration:none" target="_blank"><h2>Grainger Engineering Library</h2></a>
		<p>
			The University of Illinois hosts the largest engineering library in the nation, Grainger 
			Engineering Library. Through this building, Student Aircraft Builders are able to take 
			advantage of technologically saturated group study and conference rooms.
