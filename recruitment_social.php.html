		<h1>
			Recruitment and Social
		</h1>
		<p>
			Student aircraft builders knows the importance of social events to provide a relaxed 
			environment where members can create lasting relations with one another and where members 
			can enjoy a little time off from their busy schedules.  As a result, SAB aspires to hold 
			numerous social events throughout the year.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Meet, Greet, and Eat
		</h2>
		<p>
			To kick of the 2013-14 school year we are going to conduct a meet, greet, and eat at the 
			SAB hanger.  This event is exactly what it sounds like; members will have the opportunity 
			to come visit the hanger, meet current or prospective SAB enthusiasts and enjoy some pizza.
		</p>
		<h2>
			SAB Half Price Burgers at Joe's
		</h2>
		<p>
			SAB invites everyone to join our weekly tradition of going to Joe's (706 S 5th St) on <b>Thursdays</b>, at <b>6pm</b> for <b>half price burgers</b> (veggie burgers are offered as well). Come out and meet your exec board and fellow members! I Take a break from your work to enjoy a half-priced meal along with some great people.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Yuri's Night
		</h2>
		<p>
			Every year aerospace students celebrate the anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's trip into outer 
			space! The Soviet pilot was the first human to make the journey and his spacecraft 
			completed its orbit of Earth on April 12th, 1961. Any student who has been to Yuri's night 
			will tell you it is the best night of the year; you do not want to miss it. We usually 
			reserve a section of a bar and are given great deals throughout the night.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Prospective Events
		</h2>
		<p>
			We have a large amount of ideas for social events, however a lot of event planning comes 
			down to time and money thus many of them will be labeled under prospective events until 
			they are finalized.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Cookouts
		</h3>
		<p>
			Cookouts are definitely one of the more likely prospective events that will be put into 
			action.  Most of you have been to a cookout for a RSO on campus and for those of you that 
			haven't, basically what the event entails is we choose a day that has nice weather and we 
			fire up the grill and make delicious food. In a few words: good weather, good food, and 
			good people.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Barcrawls
		</h3>
		<p>
			There will be numerous barcrawls SAB will be participating in throughout the year, but the dates 
			will not be known until much later. A barcrawl is a night where a large group of students move 
			from bar to bar on the hour (on a planned route) and enjoy a night to mingle, let loose, and 
			maybe even sing some karaoke.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Capture the Flag
		</h3>
		<p>
		    Capture the flag is game we all remember playing as kids. With the beautiful campus we have, 
			I think a large scale capture the flag on a weather permitting day would be awesome!
		</p>
		<h3>
			Movie Night
		</h3>
		<p>
			Movie nights are self-explanatory. We will select a movie (most likely aerospace related) 
			and rent out a room such as 103 Talbot or a room in the Illini Union. Also order pizza or 
			other refreshments, and enjoy a laid back night with fellow engineering students.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Get Involved!
		</h2>
		<p>
			The above prospective events are just a list of some of the ideas we plan to implement. 
			We have other ideas we are working with that are not listed above. I would love to hear any 
			ideas or suggestion you have so please do not hesitate to email me at: 
			<a href="mailto:pspatel2@illinois.edu">pspatel2@illinois.edu</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anyone interested in getting involved in planning social events for SAB please apply
