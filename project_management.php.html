		<h1>
			Project Management
		</h1>
		<h3>
			What is it?
		</h3>
		<h2>
			The Short Answer:
		</h2>
		<p>
			Project Management, in SAB terms, is the process through which a part is made ready for
			assembly.
		</p>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/JZStahcYxTU?wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<h2>
			The Long Answer:
		</h2>
		<h4>
			An Interpreter
		</h4>
		<p>
			To understand exactly what Project Management encompasses, it is important to understand
			how a single person buying a kit plane would go about assembling it. The plane we will be
			building is a kit plane. Every part comes with a set of factory instructions
			and technical draws from which the person assembling the plane (�builder�) is to interpret.
			Through the combination of analyzing the technical drawings and carefully reading the
			instructions, the builder determines the steps that must be taken to correctly assemble a
			part.<br/>
			It is the goal of SAB that, through the process of separating the interpretation of drawings
			and part assembly, there is never any downtime in the assembly processes. Project Management,
			by being separate from the Construction Team, is allowed to focus solely on the
			interpretation of instructions.
		</p>
		<h4>
			A Divider of Tasks
		</h4>
		<p>
			The freedom of divorcing interpretation from construction allows the Project Management Team
			to focus its energy on involving more than one builder in the assembly process at a time.
			It is the goal of SAB to have Build Sessions support the efforts of three builders working
			at the same time. As it stands, the instructions provided by the manufacturer support the
			efforts of one builder working at one time. It then becomes a goal of Project Management
			to not only understand the instructions and drawings, but tailor them to the efforts of
			three builders working simultaneously.
		</p>
		<h4>
			A Resource Leveler
		</h4>
		<p>
			As we are an RSO we have only so many resources available to us. This has put a limit on
			the number of tools we possess. This must be considered when breaking the instructions
			into tasks for three builders working together.
		</p>
		<h4>
			A Writer of Instructions
		</h4>
		<p>
			Another aspect of the project that must be taken into consideration is the level of
			technical experience members of the Construction Team possess. SAB was founded on the idea
			that <i>students</i> could build aircraft. That being said, the familiarity builders will have
			with sheet metal must be taken into account. Factory instructions were made with the
			assumption that the builder has an excellent understanding of sheet metal construction.
			For SAB, this is many times not the case. Therefore the Project Management Team must create
			instructions suited to its student audience.
		</p>
		<h4>
			A Presenter
		</h4>
		<p>
			Beyond just the editing of instructions, to make builders feel as comfortable as possible
			with the work they will be doing, presentations will be created outlining the major steps
			and sources for error that may accompany an individual part.
		</p>
		<h3>
			In Summary:
		</h3>
		<p>
			Project Management is:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Interpreting instructions and technical drawings</li>
			<li>Creating instructions accessible for students</li>
			<li>Breaking down factory instructions so three people may build on the plane at once</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Resource leveling (strategically planning so tools may be utilized to the best of our
					ability</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Creating presentations to introduce builders to a part on which they will be working.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>
			Dynamic Instructions
		</h3>
		<p>
			Project Management in SAB is responsible for interpreting factory instructions and technical drawings, creating airplane assembly instructions that are accessible for students, breaking down factory instructions so three people may build on the plane at once, resource leveling (strategically planning so tools may be utilized to the best of our ability), and creating presentations to introduce builders to a part on which they will be working. The SAB Project Management Team writes one set of master instructions that lists all steps as if the plane would be built by one person with relevant constraints applied. From there, every step in the instructions is analyzed for three things: What steps must be completed before a step may begin? What tools does this step use? What parts are involved with this step?<br/>
			<br/>
			After these three constraints are analyzed, Project Management plugs the information into Microsoft Project and breaks the master set of instructions into three sets of instructions, but these instructions make many assumptions about builder skill and timing within a build session.<br/>
			<br/>
			To fix this we are building a program that utilizes our a database of steps (and the constraints corresponding to each step). During construction the program display steps that could be completed given the current state of constraints. The program then tracks the builders' process through the user interface and intelligently determines the next step for the builders to complete.<br/>
