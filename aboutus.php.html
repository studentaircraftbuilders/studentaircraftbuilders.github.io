		<h1>
			About Us
		</h2>
		<h2>
			Who Are The Student Aircraft Builders?
		</h2>
		<p>
			We are an interdisciplinary team of University of Illinois students that will construct
			and modify a kit aircraft for research purposes. Our initial step of building an aircraft
			from a kit will give us a strong familiarity with every aspect of an aircraft. Through personally
			constructing a kit aircraft, we will not only know every component that needs to
			be incorporated into the aircraft, but we will also be able to vastly improve our
			understanding of each component's functionality.<br/>
			<br/>
			Like most student engineering projects, we are building and designing to a deadline, with
			the intention to prove our merit. Unfortunately, as we are pioneers in this venture, no
			standardized collegiate competition exists. We have, however, found something comparable.
			We aim to take home the Oskosh AirVenture 2014 Homebuilt Lindy Award. Named after aviation
			hero Charles Lindbergh, the Lindy Awards acknowledge the tireless effort to create an
			aircraft that is truly best of show.<br/>
			<br/>
			Following full FAA certification for the aircraft and the completion of the requisite
			flight test hours, we hope to proceed with FAA authorized modifications using inspiration
			from our academic background in engineering. Additionally, we have received interest in
			the use of our aircraft as a research platform for other projects on campus. Potential
			research topics include structural analysis, experimental software for avionics, and even
			alternative propulsion systems; our research possibilities are only limited by our own
			imagination.<br/>
			<br/>
			Furthermore, our mission is to not only personally advance the technology used in airplanes,
			but to also inspire others to do the same. Through educational outreach, we hope to inspire
			the next generation of engineers. Some of us only recently realized our dream of creating
			new technology, and can only imagine what we could have already accomplished if we had
			realized this earlier. Therefore, reaching out, and giving others experiences and
			opportunities that could potentially change their future and the future of aerospace
			engineering is vastly important to us.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Why This, Why Us?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Every engineering student should have the opportunity to work on an undergraduate project.
			Members will learn teamwork, organizational skills, administrative techniques, communicating
			and supporting ideas, time management, and most importantly, hands on experience in an
			engineering project. We will have professional workshops on riveting, MIG and TIG welding,
			and training sessions with power tools including sanders, grinders, and drills.<br/>
			<br/>
			Engineering students are uniquely suited to construction projects on this scale. A baseline
			understanding of structural and fluid dynamic processes is critical for all engineering
			disciplines, especially Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering. Due to the project's relevancy
			in their fields, the greatest member interest has come from students in those majors.
			Students from disciplines such as Civil and Industrial Engineering have been able to
			contribute a more specialized knowledge base, providing their skills in  structure analysis
			and project management. It is our hope to attract students in Computer Science and Electrical
			Engineering with our research plans.<br/>
			<br/>
			In the process of construction, our members will see the design concerns needed in the
			entirety of the aircraft, down to the placement of a single rivet. Through restrictions and
			regulations placed by the FAA and Vans Aircraft, as well as recommendations from experienced
			engineering students and aircraft experts, students will learn the importance of safety
			factors and other techniques used to prevent failure. This hands-on approach to learning
			will grant a background in applied engineering which will easily apply to larger scale
			projects.<br/>
			<br/>
			In the founding and organization of all projects of this scale, students suited to roles in
			administration and advanced planning are absolutely essential. With help from former
			executives of organizations on campus, students will develop existing organizational and
			resource management skills. The size of this undertaking allows students to take on
			positions which correspond to their schedule and dedication to the project.
