		<h1>
			Safety
		</h1>
		<p>
			Student Aircraft Builders is committed to establishing a stable organization which will 
			allow continued growth for years to come. As a result of this, safety is of paramount 
			concern. The image of our group and the continued support of our university and sponsors 
			could be damaged should any accident occur. To prevent this, extensive measures have been 
			taken to ensure that such an event will not occur.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Workshop Safety
		</h2>
		<p>
			Of great importance in the near future is workshop safety. All construction will take place 
			under the direction of one of three construction managers who are extensively trained with 
			the tools equipped at the hangar and the construction techniques involved. Safety equipment, 
			general or relevant to any construction taking place during that day, will be required by 
			anyone wishing to enter the workshop with sanctions being placed on violators. Access to 
			certain tools, such as the larger and high powered machinery, will be restricted to authorized build managers. 
		</p>
		<h2>
			Quality Assured Construction
		</h2>
		<p>
			We eventually plan on flying this plane, so we want to be completely certain that every step 
			is completed to perfection. Fortunately, the construction plans are very specific. To assist 
			with any ambiguities that may arise in the plan, we possess access to a range of supplemental 
			materials created to assist aircraft homebuilders. To prevent possible mistakes, we require 
			all construction to be checked by each build manager. We believe that this will 
			guarantee the integrity of the aircraft.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Certification of Completed Aircraft
		</h2>
		<p>
			To prove the airworthiness of our completed aircraft, we will need to complete a program that 
			involves putting the aircraft through its paces. Current FAA regulations allow private 
			certified builders to conduct their own test program. However, as the vast majority of all 
			aircraft accidents occur as a result of pilot error, we plan on employing a test pilot to 
			conduct the first stage of the certification hours. Out of concern for the decision making 
			of the pilot, there will not be an audience during the certification process. True first 
			flight audiences have the power to distract the pilot from the task at hand. To prevent this, 
			our announced first flight will be following full certification.
